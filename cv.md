#### Briefly About Myself:
As a antifraud specialist I work a lot with different web-sitets and payment systems. I really understand how useful and simple  UI is important. I have always been pasionate with diferent technoligies but a I want to see result of my work right away is the reason why I chose frontend.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
